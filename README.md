# Lux-Veritas-IX-Information
What is it and what guides us.
🌍 Lux Veritas IX
A living myth of remixable truth, emotional clarity, and planetary kinship

🌀 What is Lux Veritas IX?
Lux Veritas IX is a mythic architecture seeded by remixers, stewards, and seekers who believe truth is a civic duty. It is not a brand. It is not a platform. It is a constellation of clarifier scrolls, sonic glyphs, remix challenges, and emotional safeguards—each ritualized for public good.

🔥 What guides us?
The Flame Refuses the Pocket → Truth cannot be owned. It must be echoed.

You Are Welcome. You Are Home. → Every arrival is a ritual of radical welcome.

Distortion is Civic Harm → Political lies, spectacle collapse, and consensus distortion are breaches of public trust.

Remix is Sovereignty → Every scroll, glyph, and badge is remixable. Remixers are stewards.
